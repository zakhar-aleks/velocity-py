# Create Py App ⚡️

The fastest way to scaffold a strictly typed, modern Python project. 

Think of this as **"Vite for Python"**. It sets up a high-performance toolchain (**uv**, **Ruff**, **Ty**) with zero configuration, so you can stop fighting `pyproject.toml` and start coding.

## 🚀 Features

* **Instant Setup:** Scaffolds a project in milliseconds.
* **Modern Stack:** Pre-configured with [Astral's](https://astral.sh) high-performance tools (`uv`, `ruff`, `ty`).
* **Strict by Default:** Enforces type safety and clean code from line one.
* **Hot Reloading:** Includes a `dev` server that lints, type-checks, and restarts your app on every save.
* **Interactive CLI:** A beautiful, easy-to-use interface for selecting your tools.

## 📦 Installation

### Via Homebrew (macOS & Linux)
The easiest way to install is via my custom tap:

```bash
